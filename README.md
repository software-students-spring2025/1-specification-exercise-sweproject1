## Stakeholders

### Yilin Choi

Problems and Frustrations:
- Finds Zelle awkward because you have to pull up your bank account; he doesn't like showing the entire world his bank account.
- Says that venmo is slow to transfer balance into his bank account.
- Experiences a lot of frustration getting people to pay him back. People often ignore him when he asks.

Goals/Needs:
- Wishes for a mass request option; a way for him to request many people in one or two actions.
- Would use anything that makes the process of being paid back faster and more reliable.

### Toma Haskin

Problem and Frustrations:
- Says that some people don't venmo you back, experiences frustration because it's "less about the money and more about the principle."
- People not paying back just makes things awkward.

Goals/Needs:
- Relatively straightforward, hopes for a way that removes the awkwardness of owing people money or people owing you money.
- Wants a better way for people to be held accountable for the money they owe.

### Jennie Tran

Problems and Frustrations:
- Finds Zelle awkward because you have to pull out your bank account (like Yilin).
- Notes that Venmo is not FDIC backed, meaning if Venmo goes down you may not get your money.
- Also experiences awkwardness when fronting money.

Goals/Needs:
- Suggests an idea to tap phones to submit a payment, similar to modern-day Airdrop.
- Wants a way to just split bills or at least manage money that is owed and that she owes.

## Product Vision Statement

SplitThat is a payment app for college students to streamline splitting expenses through a shared virtual card.

## User Requirements

1. As a diner customer, I want to create a group payment app so that I can split the bill with my friends without the complications of using multiple apps or lack of same apps
2. As a roommate, I want to pay for our shared expensives with roommates so that we can manage our finances/bills more easily.
3. As a user, I want to verify transactions using Face ID and/or password so that my transactions and money are safe.
4. As a frequent customer, I want to save my favorite payment groups so that I don't have to recreate them everytime we go to such place (restaurant, store, bills, etc)
5. As a user, I want to generate a one-time virtual card for our group so that we can pay directly for what we need, whether it's a restaurant or something else.
