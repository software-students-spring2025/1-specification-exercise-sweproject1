## Stakeholders

### Yilin Choi

Problems and Frustrations:
- Finds Zelle awkward because you have to pull up your bank account; he doesn't like showing the entire world his bank account.
- Says that venmo is slow to transfer balance into his bank account.
- Experiences a lot of frustration getting people to pay him back. People often ignore him when he asks.

Goals/Needs:
- Wishes for a mass request option; a way for him to request many people in one or two actions.
- Would use anything that makes the process of being paid back faster and more reliable.

### Toma Haskin

Problem and Frustrations:
- Says that some people don't venmo you back, experiences frustration because it's "less about the money and more about the principle."
- People not paying back just makes things awkward.

Goals/Needs:
- Relatively straightforward, hopes for a way that removes the awkwardness of owing people money or people owing you money.
- Wants a better way for people to be held accountable for the money they owe.

### Jennie Tran

Problems and Frustrations:
- Finds Zelle awkward because you have to pull out your bank account (like Yilin).
- Notes that Venmo is not FDIC backed, meaning if Venmo goes down you may not get your money.
- Also experiences awkwardness when fronting money.

Goals/Needs:
- Suggests an idea to tap phones to submit a payment, similar to modern-day Airdrop.
- Wants a way to just split bills or at least manage money that is owed and that she owes.

## Product Vision Statement

SplitThat is a payment app for college students to streamline splitting expenses through a shared virtual card.

## User Requirements

1. As a diner customer, I want to use a group payment app so that I can split the bill with my friends without the complications of using multiple apps or lack of same apps (Venmo, Zelle, Cashapp, etc.)
2. As a roommate, I want to pay for our shared expensives with roommates so that we can manage our finances/bills more easily.
3. As a user, I want to verify transactions using Face ID and/or password so that my transactions and money are safe.
4. As a frequent customer, I want to save my favorite payment groups so that I don't have to recreate them everytime we go to such place (restaurant, store, bills, etc)
5. As a user, I want to generate a one-time virtual card for our group so that we can pay directly for what we need, whether it's a restaurant or something else.
6. As a college student who budgets monthly, I want to be sure that I'm not missing any money so that I don't have to live with the financial burdens of someone not paying me back in time. 
7. As someone who often times forgets to pay my friends back after eating out together, I want to ensure that they aren't missing money so that they don't have to worry about people not paying them back when they should.
8. As someone who doesn't have any apps like cash app, Venmo, etc, I want to be able to ensure that I'm paying my friends same day or receiving money from my friends same day so there aren't any problems of people not receiving/giving money
9. As a someone with social anxiety, I want to be able to eat with friends/new people so that I don't have the burden of having to approach the new person(s) and asking them to pay me back.
10. As someone who eats out a lot with friends, I want us to be able to pay the bill in full so that we don't have to ask whether we can split the bill amongst multiple people.
